# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
In this project we developed and optimized different ML regression models to predict medical insurance charges from personal attributes. We performed EDA, feature engineering, log transformation for heteroscedasticity and k-fold cross-validation, achieving best R-squared value of 0.8884 after tuning hyperparameters on the top-performing model.
